class Neurosurgery_Pathway:
    """
    Defines a model that puts patients through a multi-step neurosurgery pathway.

    Parameters
    ------

    run_number: int
        Unique identifier for the simulation run.

    referrals_per_week: int, default is `g.referrals_per_week`
        Average number of new referrals received to this pathway per week.

    surg_clinic_per_week: int, default is `g.surg_clinic_per_week`
        Number of surgical clinics per week. Default is `g.surg_clinic_per_week`.

    surg_clinic_capacity: int, default is `g.surg_clinic_capacity`
        Capacity (number of people it is possible to see) of a surgical clinic.

    theatre_list_per_week: int, default is `g.theatre_list_per_week`
        Number of theatre lists per week. Default is `g.theatre_list_per_week`.

    theatre_list_capacity: int, default is `g.theatre_list_capacity`
        Capacity (number of people it is possible to operate on) of a single theatre list.

    trauma_list_per_week: int, default is `g.trauma_list_per_week`
        Number of trauma lists per week. Default is `g.trauma_list_per_week`.

    weekly_extra_patients: int, default is `g.weekly_extra_patients`
        Number of extra patients for trauma lists per week.

    prob_needs_surgery: float, default is `g.prob_needs_surgery`
        Probability a patient needs surgery post-clinic.

    fill_non_admitted_queue: int, default is `g.fill_non_admitted_queue`.
        Initial non-admitted queue size (patients who are waiting for clinic appointment and potentially surgery).

    fill_admitted_queue: int, default is `g.fill_admitted_queue`
        Initial admitted queue size (patients who have had clinic appointment but not surgery).

    sim_duration: int, default is `g.sim_duration`
        Duration of the simulation; interpreted as a number of weeks.
        Note that the simulation run may exceed this duration so that the full journey of all patients
        who enter the simulation prior to the point specified by sim_duration will complete their
        full journies.
